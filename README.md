# Podcasty

Podcasty is super eraly stages, but my goal is to build a simple and easy to use
podcast self hosting platform that allows you to upload episodes, import
existing podcasts, etc. It surves as a custom backend for your podcast website.
With it you'll be able to spin up a OpenAI wisper client and auto transcribe
your episodes. You'll also be able to use whatever object store you want.

Then all of this data is availble to be queried from GraphQL to your podcast
frontend, so you have total freedom to do whatever you want. it's completely
headless.

## What's The Stack?

we are using the [epic stack](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack). This
made the starting point a lot easier. I also am using
[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI because I think it looks a lot nicer
than the standard [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) theme.
